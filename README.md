## Story
Many people are looking for specifical plants or flowers which sometimes are not easy to find locally.
On the other hand, there are people who can have too many flowers because each of them grow up. 
So instead of throwing their plants in the trash, they could sell or share them.

This is why I created FindMyPlant.
